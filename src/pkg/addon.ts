  // Choice after the selection. However, given that we need to return
  // `Choices[]` we need to decode all of them even if they're not all being
  // used which is wasteful. This shouldn't be *that* bad as its a very small
  // list, but its still wasted work. Switching the top-level API to return an
  // Iterable<Choice> doesn't help as we need both the length and the ability to
  // randomly access it, so the best way to make the current API fast would be
  // to have the Zig bindings create Choice objects directly, only that won't
  // scale well as it would require us to basically rewrite the low-level
  // choices function for each generation within node.zig. We could do something
  // really galaxy-brained and return some sort of frankenstein subclass of
  // Array backed by ArrayBuffer which would lazily decode the Choice on access,
  // but thats ultimately not worth the effort.
